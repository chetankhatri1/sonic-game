You'll need the following images:

1. background.png - A side-scrolling platformer background (Green Hills style)
2. ring.png - Golden ring icon
3. Character sprites for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy

You can find free Sonic-themed images online or create simple placeholder images.
For now, the game uses colored blocks for characters and objects.
